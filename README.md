# Hi,  I'm Cyril 👋

## About Me ?

**Who am I?**  
I was trained at BeCode in Belgium, where I gained strong skills in web development. Throughout my journey, I deepened my knowledge of web technologies, working on complex projects and developing strong collaboration abilities.  

Curious and passionate about new technologies, I'm always seeking challenges that help me grow and expand my skills.  

Recently, I worked as a front-end developer trainee at Pushapp in Naples (01.2025 – 03.2025), creating responsive web interfaces, collaborating with design and back-end teams, and independently managing client feedback integration.

**What are you currently learning?**  
I’m currently developing a Budget Manager application with Next.js, working on both front-end interfaces and back-end API routes. This project helps me strengthen my full-stack skills

**What do you work on?**  
I mainly focus on web and mobile projects, building clean and efficient solutions.
